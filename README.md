## Introduction

This is due in huge part to the success of the Netflix series "Stranger Things" Season 4 which is also explained on this website. The website also briefly explains the history of how Kate begain using the Fairlight CMI Synthesizer, which hugely shaped her sound on this song and many others. This website is targeted to Kate Bush fans, but mostly to the new young fans she aquired through the sudden resurgence of the hit song.
